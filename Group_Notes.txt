(3/10/20)
- created 3 new notebooks in "Fall2014" and "Catalogs" for breakdown of individual csv files

- In FALL2014 (for COURSES), isnull didn't pick up missing values- missing values are denoted by '[]' in these files, not NaN. I specifically checked for [] in course_meetings_breakdown, but I visually looked at the other csv files (COURSECATALOG for COURSES and COURSE_MEETINGS) to determine NULL/NOT NULL for our database index. If we have time, we should try to figure out a code that can search for it throughout the table in case they exist in other columns.
